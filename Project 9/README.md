98% prediction is the best I would achieve. The one mistake could be considering the married individual as divorced. There are many reasons this mistake would have happened. Perhaps the individual scored negative, regardless of the feelings, the person was still married. This would not be an odd situation, as the person would be unhappy but still married for religious beliefs, for the kids, or the cultural reasons. The participants of the dataset were from Turkey and 96 out of the 170 respondents had an arranged marriage. Achieving 98% is amazing, but trying to get 100% is na√Øve. Accuracy could be better by having more observation on  religion, children, arranged marriage, etc
