Selection of Model based on Hotel Reviews.docx

As I progressed and discussed with my professor, I decided to build and train a model for the same kind of data. I wanted to try different models and gain experience and check the accuracy of all of them. Below are the models I built and trained:

- Random Forest Classifier

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Linear Regression

- Neural Network
