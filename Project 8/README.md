The focus of this project was to come up with the top ten recommendations for the movies. The reason is that we have a lot of movies to watch these days because of the pandemic. More time is available, and more movies are listed. If I were to watch a movie, I would randomly pick a movie that I see in front of me, and think is interesting. I would give a glance at the trailer and finalize the movie to watch. But when I have recommendations, I would pick one of them from the recommendations since they would match my taste, as well as the viewers, have liked them. With that in mind, movie recommendations will be of great help to me especially when there are ten of them. The ten recommendations have been different as per the user. Hence recommendations are expected to be liked by all.
