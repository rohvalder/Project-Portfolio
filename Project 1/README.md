Below are a few of my conclusions based on the visualization:
- Fatal accidents 85-99: The bar graph displays the fatal accidents during 85 to 99 along with the Airline name. I tried to filter the airlines only which had fatal accidents from 1985 to 2014.
- Fatal accidents 00-14: The bar graph shows the same data as above but from 00 to 14. As you can observe, the pattern is not consistent, and the fatal accidents get better when compared to 85-99.
- Fatalities: The pair of line chart shows if there was at least a fatality from 1985 – 2014. The pair of lines are not uniform, and hence the fatalities are not repeating with the airlines from the mentioned different year ranges.
- Total Fatalities: The top 5 airlines with fatalities from 1985 -2014 are plotted using a bar chart. As per the data, 4 out of 5 airlines which are 80% of the airlines are from Asia.
- Incidents: The number of incidents from 1985 – 2014 is plotted using pie which I wanted to showcase like a scatter. As mentioned earlier, the incidents have reduced in the second range of years.
- Deaths by Travel: The data from the supplement shows a scatter plot of deaths by different vehicles. The least deaths are by flying and hence it proves flying is safe.
